Hi there.

This is the new place to stay in touch with the latest news about the
txt2tags project. Releases, files, documents, translations, site
updates.

The good old do-it-yourself news/RSS by hand worked until today, but
using a Blog system like WordPress, we get some advantages:

-   Feeds (RSS) with HTML code. The old "by hand" was text-only.
-   Automatic feeds for: whole blog, each category, each post, all
    comments, comments by post.
-   Permanent (readable) URL for each post, important to keep things
    organized and easy to find.
-   Multiple categories (tags) to mark each post, so you can monitor
    just want interests you.
-   And more.

Talking about feeds, [subscribe to the txt2tags blog
now](feed:http://txt2tags.wordpress.com/feed/)!

But my favorite feature is having comments for each post. Now everybody
can talk and contribute, changing the monologue to a nice conversation.

It's up and running. Enjoy!

> Note: Here are [the older
> news](http://txt2tags.org/oldnews.html), just in case.
