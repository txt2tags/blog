Txt2tags was included into [Rudix](http://rudix.org), a collection of
ready-to-use Unix/Linux software for the Mac. Each software is packaged
with the default Mac installer, so you just have to press the "Continue"
button a few times and it's done. No need to install a subsystem like
Fink or DarwinPorts.

> Remember HTMLDOC from the last post? It's also on Rudix!
