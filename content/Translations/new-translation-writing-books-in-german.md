Hello! Just a quick post to inform you that [the
team](http://txt2tags.sourceforge.net/team/) grew even more:

-   **Michael Malien** translated the Writing Books to German.
-   **Martin J. Ponce** revised the Spanish program messages (potfile).

Their work is already online on the [documentation
page](http://txt2tags.sourceforge.net/docs.html).
