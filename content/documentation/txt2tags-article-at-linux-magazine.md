The man who made the article is our old time friend **Dmitri Popov**,
who already wrote "[Minimalist tools for
writers](/2006/08/25/quit-your-text-processor/)" and created the
excellent
[QuasiWiki](/2006/11/09/quasiwiki-txt2tags-extension-for-openofficeorg/)
(Txt2tags extension for OpenOffice.org).

Thanks again Dmitri!
