Jokes apart, this the format of the [Choose Your Own Adventure
books](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choose_Your_Own_Adventure), where
the reader can decide the flow (an the end) of the story.

What if you want to make **your very own CYOA book**?

You could use a PDF file as the book, it has pages. As a bonus, you can
also use direct links to the pages on the "turn to page 4" excerpts,
improving the user experience.

Looks cool enough? And what if I say that you can do it all in a single
nice flat text file?

**Eric Forgeot** has written an article teaching how to transform a text
file into a full CYOA book, using txt2tags. The article is itself a
CYOA, check it out now: [txt2CYOA : a "choose your own adventure" easily
