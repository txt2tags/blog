Check out his [Static Site Creation
Guide](http://neidetcher.com/static_site_creation.html), featuring
detailed tips on how to use txt2tags, m4 and make to create and maintain
a full website.

Excerpts:

> I have developed websites in Python (CGI and Django), PHP, Perl, .NET,
> Java (Struts, WebWork, Java Server Faces) and finally Ruby on Rails.
> However, I don't always have the need to do a full-blown, database
> backed website that uses a complicated framework. Sometimes simple
> HTML will suffice.
>
> Finally I can **focus on content** without having to resort to a
> WYSIWYG tool and still get nicely formatted pages.

Enjoy!
