**Matthias Kilian** has packaged txt2tags for the OpenBSD distribution.
And since version 2.3! It's my fault not telling you about it before.

The details about the package can be found on
<http://ports.openbsd.nu/textproc/txt2tags>.

Off-topic: Have you noticed the two Matthias on the recent news? :)
