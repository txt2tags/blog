Seems like yesterday when [we made
five](http://txt2tags.wordpress.com/2006/07/26/5-years-of-txt2tags/)...
But now we're **seven**!

To celebrate this very special date (it's real hard to keep a spare-time
one-man project like txt2tags for that long), there's a new 2.5 version
out there!

It's not one. Not even two. But three new targets!

-   [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia)
-   [Google Code Wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_code)
-   [DokuWiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dokuwiki)

Maybe you'll write an article on Wikipedia, maybe you'll update your
Google Code project or maybe you'll edit some DokuWiki page. In any
case, txt2tags is your friend!

Keep using the same \*\*marks\*\* //you// \_\_already\_\_
``` `` ```know``` `` ``` and let txt2tags do the dirty job of converting
them to those new targets. The new codes for the -t option are **wiki**,
**gwiki** and **doku**. Enjoy!

Talking about marks, have you ever needed to ~~strikeout~~ something?
Now you can! Txt2tags 2.5 brings a new mark: `--`strike`--`. Simple!

There's also a [new PHP
interface](http://txt2tags.sourceforge.net/online.php), better UTF-8
support, local links for LaTeX, [new
tools](http://txt2tags.sourceforge.net/tools.html) and more!

Check out the new guide: [How to add a new target to
txt2tags](http://txt2tags.sourceforge.net/new-target.html). I guess the
name is self-describing, right? How about to get involved to the
project, adding a new target?

Talking about collaboration, this release was sponsored by a generous
donation from **Dmitri Popov**, who runs the [No Thick
Manuals](http://www.nothickmanuals.info) site and [have already helped
lots of open source
projects](http://www.nothickmanuals.info/doku.php/donations). Thank you
Dmitri!

What now? [Try the new
version](http://txt2tags.sourceforge.net/online.php) (online) and
