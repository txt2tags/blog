Please update your bookmarks and mental notes :)

[Sourceforge](http://sourceforge.net) served us since the start, back in
2001. A big THANK YOU to the SF team for everything, all these years.
After almost 10 years, we moved. [Google
Code](http://code.google.com/p/txt2tags/) takes care of downloads, SVN
and issue tracker, and [DreamHost](http://www.dreamhost.com) hosts the
web site.
