I've always waited until many new features and bug fixes were done to
then release a new version of txt2tags. The more changes, the better.

But experience show me that preparing big releases is a time consuming
task, and it takes even longer when the period between versions becomes
large. Since the latest version 2.3 was released 13 months ago, you can
imagine how scared I am :)

We need change and we need it fast, Joey said.

Starting today, besides de [KISS
Principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_Principle), the program
will also follow the "[Release Early, Release
Often](http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/ar01s04.html)"
Principle. Minor releases will now be part of the project.

And when I said now, I mean `--now`! See next post.
