At July 26, 2001 the txt2tags version 0.1 was released.

It had six targets (txt, html, sgml, pm6, mgp, moin), command line was
the only interface (with just one option -t), a few supported structures
and marks, no translations, poor documentation, a dozen users, [461
lines of code](http://txt2tags.sf.net/txt2tags-0.1.py.txt).

Today its code is [10 times bigger](http://txt2tags.sf.net/txt2tags), we
have many options and features, translations to 10+ languages, extensive
documentation, a great world-wide user base and a nice team of
contributors.

I'm happy to notice that even getting this far, txt2tags continues to
honor its very first and most important goal: **be simple**. The markup
keeps being easy and minimalist. The advanced features are available if
you need them, but aren't required for the daily use.

The program also entered on a mature stage. The latest version was
released about a year ago and no important bugs were found on this
period. In this case, no news is good news :)

But wait, news are coming soon. Hold your breath for the next posts.

Thanks everybody for your support on my little project for all these
years. Let's hope in 2011 I can write a post called "10 years and we're
still here" :)
