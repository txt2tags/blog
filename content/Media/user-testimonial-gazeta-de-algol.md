**Roberto Bechtlufft** wrote me to tell that he moved all his old [site
about Phantasy Star](http://linuxparaoresgate.com/gazeta/index.php)
(remember Sega's Master System and Mega Drive?) to a PHP plus txt2tags
solution.

He has documented the process on the site, telling why txt2tags was a
great choice. [His
text](http://linuxparaoresgate.com/gazeta/como_e_feita_a_gazeta.php) is
in Portuguese, but you can read the [English version translated by
Google](http://translate.google.com/translate?u=http%3A%2F%2Flinuxparaoresgate.com%2Fgazeta%2Fcomo_e_feita_a_gazeta.php&langpair=pt%7Cen&hl=en&ie=UTF8 "//linuxparaoresgate.com/gazeta/como_e_feita_a_gazeta.php"),
which is good enough (for a machine). ;)
