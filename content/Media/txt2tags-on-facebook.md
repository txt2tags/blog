strikes [again](/2009/09/17/txt2tags-in-geany-editor/)! He just created
a special place for you txt2tags users in Facebook. I'll quote Eric's
announce:

> Hello,
>
> I've made a fan page for txt2tags on facebook.
>
> It's just to show our interest in the syntax and software, so we could
> maybe bring more newcomers.
>
> This page is not like a group (a place to exchange pictures and a
> miniforum), I don't expect people to post questions or discuss about
> txt2tags there, it's just to state we like txt2tags.
>
> I plan to post a few articles thought to show how cool txt2tags is...
