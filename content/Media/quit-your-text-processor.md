Are you a writer? What about not using a text processor to write your
text? Read on, I promise it will make sense :)

There's a nice article about text-only writing at Linux.com. Three tools
are mentioned to substitute the big memory-hungry Office processor:

-   A text editor - Vi
-   A formatting tool - **txt2tags**
-   A spell checker - Aspell

Check it out! [Minimalist tools for
writers](http://www.linux.com/archive/feed/56506) by Dmitri Popov.

For more detailed information, read the [Writing Books with
Txt2tags](http://txt2tags.org/writing-book.html) document.
