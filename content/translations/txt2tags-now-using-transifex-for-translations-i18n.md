Hi there,

Just a quick note to tell you that we're now using the excellent
[Transifex](http://transifex.net) to manage the program translation
(potfile, PO files, i18n).

Transifex makes it easy to contribute improving a translation or adding
a new one. You can do it all in their website, no need to download or
install anything. Their online editor is integrated to Google Translate,
making it even easier to translate the sentences.

This is a live image showing the current status of the program
translation:

Your language is listed there? How about to bring it to 100%? It's
quick! Just a few sentences.

Not listed? How about to add your language to txt2tags? It's a matter of
minutes.

Either way, go to the txt2tags translation central:
