now comes with a nice solution for those inspired LaTeX lovers who
prefer the simple txt2tags markup:
[TeXtallion](http://anamnese.online.fr/site2/textallion/samples/presentation.html).

I'll let Eric explain his creation:

The project was made because of our consideration for the good and
appealing quality of the LaTeX output, and also because of our love for
the simplicity of txt2tags.

But there is also much frustration with LaTeX, it's perfect for writing
scientific and complex books, but there is not way to quickly start
writing prosa with it, without enduring the intrusive and complex
syntax.

The goal of TeXtallion is to use txt2tags as a preprocesseur, and keep
its non-distracting formating marks, while being able to export easily
into LaTeX and html. Txt2tags can already export to LaTeX, but there is
little control on the output.

The TeXtallion is not a piece of software, it's just some templates,
rules and makefile for txt2tags.

So with it you can publish on paper ([pdf
example](http://anamnese.online.fr/site2/textallion/samples/sample_en.pdf)),
web page ([html
example](http://anamnese.online.fr/site2/textallion/samples/sample_en.html)),
or ebook ([epub
example](http://anamnese.online.fr/site2/textallion/samples/sample_en.epub)),
from an unique source ([source for all the previous
documents](http://anamnese.online.fr/site2/textallion/samples/sample_en.html)).

By default, TeXtallion will have all that is needed for writing a simple
and nice looking book or roman:

Bold, italic, underligned, striked letters, colored text, page
numbering, top header with title and separating line, bullet lists and
numbered lists, image includes, support for footnotes, table of content.
