You know what is a [wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki), right?
It's a collaborative website where visitors can read and **change** its
contents. Think [Wikipedia](http://wikipedia.org).

What you may don't know is that the wiki concept can be brought to your
own computer, running as a nice standalone application. Then you can
easily edit multiple documents using all the wiki's benefits: save,
compare (diff), restore, organize and link them.

That's just what **Kees Remmelzwaal** has made.
[Wixi](http://wixi.sourceforge.net) is a desktop wiki application that
runs on Linux, Windows and Macs.

But wait, there's more!

-   Guess which is the markup used by this software, when editing
    documents?
-   Guess which program is used to convert this markup to HTML, LaTeX
    and many other formats?

Txt2tags. Txt2tags.

If you are getting crazy trying to organize all those t2t files hanging
around your disk, you should definitely [give Wixi a
try](http://wixi.sourceforge.net).
