![](http://txt2tags.org/team/img/darchino.jpg)**Stefano
D'Archino** did it again. First he made the [Gedit syntax
file](http://txt2tags.wordpress.com/2007/06/19/txt2tags-and-gedit/), so
you can get nice colors in your txt2tags source files. Now he made new
syntax files for the following text editors: JOE, "le" and "ne"!

If you're using one of these editors, install the Stefano files and
enjoy your new colorful life :)

You can get those files at the [tools
page](http://txt2tags.org/tools.html), in txt2tags website.
