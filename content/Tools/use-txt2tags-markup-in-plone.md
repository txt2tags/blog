Alava (Shagi)** has made a nice add-on (transform) to
[Plone](http://plone.org/), to integrate txt2tags into it. Here's the
README file description:

> This package gives Plone users the ability to use [txt2tags
> syntax](http://txt2tags.sourceforge.net/markup.html) in their Plone
> site. Currently Plone 3.3 and 4.1 are supported.
>
> In this transform the first three lines of txt2tags files are ignored
> letting Plone setting the title, author, etc.

Shagi also adds that:

> The product is uploaded to [plone
> collective](http://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/collective.transform.txt2tags),
> so anyone can fix or enhance. There is also a
> [BTS](http://lagunak.gisa-elkartea.org/projects/plone-txt2tags).
