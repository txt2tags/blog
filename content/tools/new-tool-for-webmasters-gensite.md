I know, you have a beautiful website that rocks the neighborhood. The
styles are all separated in nice CSS files. The contents are text files
that you convert to HTML with txt2tags, of course!

It works just fine.

But everytime you edit some file, you have to remember to convert it to
HTML. And maybe you also have to copy this updated file to your web
server.

For just a few files you can do it by hand every time. But as the site
grows, it's easy to lose control.

Enter [Dave Fancella's gensite
tool](http://www.davefancella.com/software/gensite.html). It's a Python
program that detects which files has been modified and automatically
converts them with txt2tags. It can also copy the generated HTML files
to a new destination. You can use command line options and even create a
configuration file to fit your conversion needs.

Go to [Dave's site](http://www.davefancella.com/software/gensite.html)
for detailed information on WHY and HOW. Oh, and yes, his site is
txt2tags powered :)
