**Jendrik Seipp** wrote me to tell about his diary
application [RedNotebook](http://digitaldump.wordpress.com/projects/rednotebook/).
As the website says:

> RedNotebook is a graphical **diary and journal** to keep track of
> notes and thoughts. It includes a calendar navigation, customizable
> templates for each day, export functionality and word clouds. You can
> also format, tag and search your entries.

If you click at the image above, I guess you'll recognize those === and
\*\* from somewhere... :)

RedNotebook uses[txt2tags
markup](http://txt2tags.sourceforge.net/markup.html) to store the diary
contents and also uses the [txt2tags
code](http://code.google.com/p/txt2tags/source/browse/trunk/txt2tags) to
format it. It's another nice example of a Python program using [txt2tags
as a
module](http://code.google.com/p/txt2tags/source/browse/trunk/#trunk/samples/module).

What about writing your notes using our beloved markup in that beautiful
application? [Give it a
try](http://digitaldump.wordpress.com/projects/rednotebook/)!
