Stefano D'Archino [told
us](http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_name=1181733636.6458.3.camel%40amilo)
about his new creation: the [txt2tags language file for
gedit](http://txt2tags.sourceforge.net/tools/txt2tags-gedit.lang).

His instructions follows:

-   Put the file in /usr/share/gtksourceview-1.0/language-spec
-   Adjust the colors for the syntax in Gedit preferences

[Zoom.Quiet](http://blog.zoomquiet.org/pyblosxom/), a long time txt2tags
user, gave us a nice screenshot of his gedit using this file:

> FYI: [gedit](http://www.gnome.org/projects/gedit/) is the official
> text editor of the GNOME desktop environment. I know you already knew
> that, but... You know :)
