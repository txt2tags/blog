Dmitri Popov, the kind txt2tags user that [wrote an interesting article
on
Linux.com](http://txt2tags.wordpress.com/2006/08/25/quit-your-text-processor/),
strikes again! This time he created an extension so you can use the
beloved [txt2tags markup](http://txt2tags.sourceforge.net/markup.html)
into [OpenOffice.org](http://www.openoffice.org)!

I'll quote Dmitri:

> I thought you would like to know that I've released a txt2tags
> extension for OpenOffice.org. This is an initial release, and
> currently it only includes the basic formatting (more advanced version
> is in works). Using the extension you can use txt2tags with
> OpenOffice.org Writer documents. Further info is available
> at:Â [http://quasiwiki.sourceforge.net](http://quasiwiki.sourceforge.net/)

Quoting some key points, from the [QuasiWiki
site](http://quasiwiki.sourceforge.net/):

-   QuasiWiki implements some of the basic principles of wiki in
    OpenOffice.org Writer.
-   The txt2tags extension allows users to apply txt2tags markup to the
    currently opened document.

Got interested? I have!
