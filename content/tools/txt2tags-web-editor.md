Let's start 2007 with good news!

[David Area](http://davidarea.com/) from Spain brings us the brand new
[Txt2tags Web Editor](http://davidarea.com/t2twebeditor).

[![Txt2tags
Web Editor](http://txt2tags.files.wordpress.com/2007/01/t2twebeditor.jpg)](http://davidarea.com/t2twebeditor "Txt2tags Web Editor")

It's a web editor for txt2tags files, similar to editors found in phpBB
forums. You write your text on the box and use the special buttons on
the left to add formatting to it. For example, to make some text appear
in monospaced font, just select it and press the "Mono" button. Quick!

The "Directives" menu is also very handy to insert all those funny %Y,
%m and friends for the `%%date` macro.

This web editor is a mix of PHP and Javascript code, licensed under the
GPL. You can [download
it](http://www.davidarea.com/static.php?page=txt2tags) if you want. The
download page is in Spanish, but just click on the green ball and be
happy.
