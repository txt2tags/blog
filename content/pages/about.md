This is the blog of the txt2tags program.

Created in 2001, txt2tags is a document generator. It can convert a
simple text file into several formats, including HTML, LaTeX, UNIX man
page, Wikipedia and MoinMoin. There are more than 15 formats for you to
choose from.

Translated to several languages, GPL licensed, written in Python, works
like a charm in Windows, Linux and Mac.

Jump to the [txt2tags website](http://txt2tags.sourceforge.net/) to
learn more about the program, or [try now the online
demo](http://txt2tags.sourceforge.net/online.php).

Enjoy!
